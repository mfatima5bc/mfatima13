:flying_saucer: Hello friend! 

I am a back-end engineer at Semantix, and I have been acting as a programmer since 2020, in that time I have learned a lot and realized how working as a team enriches your journey and makes you evolve much more!

:ringed_planet: What I’m studying:

At the moment, I’m studying some advanced topics about Node.js, such as streams and multi-threading, but I love studying architecture and design patterns.
