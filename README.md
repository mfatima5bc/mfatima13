## Hello word!!

I am Back End Engineer at Semantix Brazil, and I have been acting as a programmer for about 2 years, in that time I have learned a lot and realized how working as a team enriches your journey and makes you evolve much more!

I like to learn new things and help those who need it!
Iâ€™ve been focusing my studies on JavaScript, typescript and architecture.
