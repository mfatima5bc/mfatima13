### Hi! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/216649417-9acc58df-9186-4132-ad43-819a57babb67.gif" width="65"> 

I am a back-end engineer at Semantix, and I have been acting as a programmer for about 3 years, in that time I have learned a lot and realized how working as a team enriches your journey and makes you evolve much more!

I like to learn new things and help those who need it!
Iâ€™ve been focusing my studies on JavaScript, typescript, and architecture. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/216655818-2e7b9a31-49bf-4744-85a8-db8a2577c45c.gif" width="65">
